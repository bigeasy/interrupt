- Hard to reconstruct from method chaining, message is formatted so that all
  information is available at crash, no neee for a special formatter at catch.
- Instance of types are painful, string matching is easy.
- Works well with Rescue which creates regular expression switch statements, but
  you could probably create a Rescue that works with `instanceof`.
